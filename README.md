# PyVault

PyVault is a WIP Python-based password manager created for my data structures in Python computer
science class.

:warning: *Warning, I am not a cryptographer and, while PyVault uses the latest technologies, I
make no guarantees that this is cryptographically safe, this was solely for a class project*

## Usage
Usage of this project requires the instillation of the following libraries:
- [argon2-cffi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/)
- [PyCryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)

You can install these with:
```sh
pip install argon2-cffi pycryptodome
```

This repository includes an example project in the `example` directory, but a graphical app could
easily be made.
